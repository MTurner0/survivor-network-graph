            42 seasons of the American reality television show <em>Survivor</em> have aired, and contestants have been returning since season 8 (in 2004).
            In this graph, <strong>vertices</strong> represent seasons.
            To see a season's name, simply <a href="https://observablehq.com/@d3/double-click-brush-clear">brush</a> over the graph (i.e. drag your cursor or your finger across the screen).
            An <strong>edge</strong> (or line) between two seasons indicates that at least one contestant played on both seasons.
            The thicker the edge, the more contestants played on both seasons.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are four types of seasons in terms of newbie/returner composition:
        </p>
        <li>
            <strong>All newbie</strong> seasons, where all contestants are on the show for their first time;
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>All returner</strong> seasons, where all contestants are playing for at least their second time;
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Half and half</strong> seasons, where half of the contestants are returning and the other half are first-time players.
            <li>
                Of the three seasons with this premise, two were themed as "Fans v. Favorites" (pitting a tribe of returning players against a tribe of unrelated first-time players) and one was "Blood v. Water" (pitting a tribe of returning players against their loved ones, who were playing for their first time).
            </li>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Captains</strong> seasons, where the majority of the contestants are first-time players, with each tribe having a returning player (the so-called "captain").
        </li>
