            Forty-two seasons of the American reality television show <em>Survivor</em> have aired, and contestants have been returning since season 8 (which aired in 2004).
            In this graph, vertices represent seasons.
            To see a season's name, simply <a href="https://observablehq.com/@d3/double-click-brush-clear">brush</a> over the graph (i.e. drag your cursor or your finger across the screen).
            An edge (or line) between two seasons indicates that at least one contestant played on both seasons.
            The thicker the edge, the more contestants played on both seasons.
